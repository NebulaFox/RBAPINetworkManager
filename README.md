# RBAPINetworkManager

Making API calls simple

## Installing

### CocoaPods

Since `RBAPINetworkManager` is still under testing and the fact I am really lazy,
you cannot just add it to the pod file like so

    pod 'RBAPINetworkManager', '~> 0.1.0'
    
instead, you have to

    pod 'RBAPINetworkManager', {:git => 'https://github.com/NebulaFox/RBAPINetworkManager.git'}
